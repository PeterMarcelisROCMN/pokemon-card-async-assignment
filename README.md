# What to do

In the script.js, there's a function called fetchPokemonImage();

This function will have to retrieve an image to paste on top of each card.

You will have to learn how to use fetch to retrieve data from a website or API.

The function fetchPokemonImage contains some comments on what you will need to achieve.

You do not have to hand in this project, but can use it to get more familiar with async functions, promises, fetch and await.
